# Overview of Election Audit: Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.
### This is a perfect example of the power of coding. We had the amount of votes in a csv. It is plenty of data to read and count. We solve this counting problem by coding!


## How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
### 369,711 votes were cast in the congressional election 

## Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.

#The above screenshot shows the total number of votes that were done. 
#We can see that the County Votes with their percentage are given. We also print the Largest County Turnout. 
## Which county had the largest number of votes?
# Denver 

## Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
# Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
# Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
# Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

## Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
# Diana DeGette won with 272,892 votes, meaning a percentage of 73.8

# Election-Audit Results: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

# In the above file it is possible to see the declared variables and the file pad. (Have plenty of commented code :D, had difficulties with it)

# In the above we are going to write down the election results so that they can be printed out.  

# Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.



#Example 1 
##The great thing about coding is that you can reuse the code. We can reuse this code for other elections. It is important to keep the format of the csv file so that our code can run properly.

In below you will need to change the file pad for it to work.

#Example2
## When we look at our code (see below), we added a conditional 'and'. 
## This 'and' is not necessary as the winning_county_count and winning_county_percentage are related. We can take out the second condition and the code will still run.

# Election_Analysis
### This code calculates the amount of votes each candidates gets. Instead of counting the votes one by one, you will use the available tools (python, github, terminal, etc) to calculate it. 

## Projection Overview
### Need to open the excel file. 
### Need to iterate through the excel and read the data.
### Need variables that know where we are iterating and counting the votes. Please note that we have different candidates three different candidates. 

## Resources
### github, have all the code and data shared 
### python, the programing language used to go through the data
### terminal, comman prompt 

## Summary
### New tools were used. Whta we learned from the tools is that you are able to relate github with terminal. This ends up being useful and handy. In github you will be able to see all the edits & updates done to the code. 

## Challenge Overview
### While coding, it will be important to always be aware of the variables and the loops. Having nested loops becomes challenging. The order of the loops is really important. In addition, having coments in the code will always help. 

## Challenge Summary
### This is a great example on how you are able to apply coding skills into real life applications.
