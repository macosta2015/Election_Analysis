# Election_Analysis
### This code calculates the amount of votes each candidates gets. Instead of counting the votes one by one, you will use the available tools (python, github, terminal, etc) to calculate it. 

## Projection Overview
### Need to open the excel file. 
### Need to iterate through the excel and read the data.
### Need variables that know where we are iterating and counting the votes. Please note that we have different candidates three different candidates. 

## Resources
### github, have all the code and data shared 
### python, the programing language used to go through the data
### terminal, comman prompt 

## Summary
### New tools were used. Whta we learned from the tools is that you are able to relate github with terminal. This ends up being useful and handy. In github you will be able to see all the edits & updates done to the code. 

## Challenge Overview
### While coding, it will be important to always be aware of the variables and the loops. Having nested loops becomes challenging. The order of the loops is really important. In addition, having coments in the code will always help. 

## Challenge Summary
### This is a great example on how you are able to apply coding skills into real life applications.
